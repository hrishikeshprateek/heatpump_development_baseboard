# ATmega328P Heat Pump Control - Recipe Reset Fix

## Issue  
The heater and fan control states are not being properly reset when a new recipe is entered. The system works fine after a manual reset, indicating that some state variables are not being cleared or reinitialized correctly when the recipe completes.

## Fix: Ensure Proper Reset on New Recipe  
To address this issue, the `completeRecipe()` function has been updated to:  
1. Turn off all relays (especially SSR).  
2. Reset all state variables.  
3. Ensure `recipeReceived = false` so that a new recipe starts cleanly.  

### Updated `completeRecipe()` Function  
Modify the function as follows:  

```cpp
void completeRecipe() {
    Serial.println(F("Recipe completed. Resetting system state."));
    allRelaysOff();
    analogWrite(FAN_PWM_PIN, 0);
    
    // Reset the state
    recipeReceived = false;
    memset(&currentState, 0, sizeof(SystemState));
    
    // Save cleared state to EEPROM
    saveSystemState();
}
```

Additional Fix: Reset prevHeater and prevFanSpeed

Before starting a new recipe, reset the heater and fan speed values to ensure they don’t retain the previous state’s incorrect values.

Modified the loadSystemState() function:

```cpp
void loadSystemState() {
    EEPROM.get(EEPROM_START_ADDR, currentState);
    
    if (!validateState()) {
        Serial.println(F("Invalid stored state, resetting to defaults"));
        resetSystemState();
        return;
    }

    DateTime now = rtc.now();
    if (currentState.targetTime > now.unixtime()) {
        recipeReceived = true;
        
        // Reset heater and fan states
        prevHeater = false;
        prevFanSpeed = 0;
        digitalWrite(RELAY_SSR, LOW);
        analogWrite(FAN_PWM_PIN, 0);

        Serial.print(F("Resuming recipe. Time remaining: "));
        Serial.println(currentState.targetTime - now.unixtime());
    } else {
        Serial.println(F("No valid recipe to resume"));
        resetSystemState();
    }
}
```

Expected Fix Behavior
	•	When a recipe finishes, the heater and fan states will reset.
	•	When a new recipe is entered, it will start fresh without inheriting previous relay states.
	•	No need to manually reset the ATmega328P anymore.
